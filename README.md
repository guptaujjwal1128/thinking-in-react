# Thinking in React

This project covers basic concepts of react.

Approach:
  - First Divide the page into small components
  - then create static components using props only. No interaction and state management.
  - Now, think about state management and interactivity as state is required only in case of user interaction.
  -  Hola, if your approach and codebase is similar to this, you have cracked the "Thinking in React" concepts.
